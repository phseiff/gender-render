# Code of Conduct

Participating in this project in any form, be it pull requests, issues, advice, suggestions or simply questions is generally always welcome.
However, there are some expectations placed on you if you want to participate, and not following them may lead to being banned from further participation in this repository.
This goes especially considering that this project is not only a software project, but also carries a social vision that should be reflected by the behavior of its participants.
This project is supposed to be a safe space for all kinds of people from all kinds of minorities, and endangering this status is therefore not appreciated.

The following rules apply to participation in issues as well as pull requests, and, if specified, beyond that.
Unless specified otherwise, the following behaviors will lead to permanent exclusion from participation of this project.

* You should use inclusive (especially gender-inclusive) language when contributing.
  Not being gender-inclusive in your language will not lead to exclusion from this project, unless it is done on purpose or you are actively not making any efford in beign gender-inclusive; this is up to the maintainers judgement.
* You may not discriminate against people based on (but not limited to) religion, ethnicity, sexuality and gender identity (and therefore, gender). 
  Similary, voicing ideals and politics that interfere with the idea of not discriminating against such minorities or the ideals of this project is not allowed.
  Voicing them outside the safe space of this repository (as long as it doesn't include malicious words towards the project) will not lead to a ban, but it will get you rightfully negatively judged by this projects maintainers and make them take a second look at your proposed changes regarding their moral integrity.
* Do not harass other contributers.
  
If you feel harassed, or you have general concerns regarding this repositories social and working climate that you don't want to voice in an issue, feel free to send me an email at `phseiff@phseiff.com`.
Please be aware, however, that resolving social issues may not always happen as soon as they occur since I am currently as well as in foreseeable future the only maintainer of this project.
