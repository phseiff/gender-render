Copyright (c) 2021 phseiff

The following license applies to the code in the test-directory and the src-directory of this repository (in case you
are reading this in the project's GitHub repository or a clone of the repository),
or the code in the test-directory and the src-directory of these files from PyPi (in case you received this License as
a part of a downloaded .tar.gz file from PyPi), depending on where you got this software from.
This includes all the code you get installed as an importable Python module on your system (by default) when using
PIP3 to install this version of the project from PyPi ("code", in this and the above context, referring to
".py"-files).

It does not, however, include any of the data sets that come with the software and are used by it; these data sets
lie in the `src/data` directory (or the data-directory relative to the package installation once the module is installed
by PIP), and are required by the softare to work correctly.
The software downloads (and potentially modifies) these data sets from the web if it doesn't find them with the
installation; they are merely included in the installation to ensure you don't run into bad surprises if you install the
package and attempt to use it offline for the first time.
