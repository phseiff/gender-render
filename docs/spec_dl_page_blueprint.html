## Download Specifications

gender\*render follows a strict set of easily implementable specifications.
There is one main specification ("spec"), as well as several extensions specifications ("ext-...").
Learn more by downloading the [main specification](https://phseiff.com/gender-render/docs/specs/spec/latest.pdf), which dives further into the versioning scheme of gender\*render specifications, their vision and development model, or download any specification in any version from the following list:

@for spec_name in sorted(open("docs/specs/specs.txt", "r").read().split("\n")):
### @{spec_name}
* [download latest](https://phseiff.com/gender-render/docs/specs/@{spec_name}/latest.pdf)
@for version in sorted(open("docs/specs/" + spec_name + "/versions.txt", "r").read().split("\n"), key=lambda v: tuple(v[1:].split("."))):
* [@{version}](https://phseiff.com/gender-render/docs/specs/@{spec_name}/@{spec_name}-@{version}.pdf)
