## Download Specifications & Changelog

gender\*render follows a strict set of easily implementable specifications.
The implementations explain in-depth which design decision was taken why and how gender\*render works exactly, but also define guidelines for re-implementing gender\*render for different programming- and well as natural languages, and contain various findings and ideas/ concepts on how to deal with various aspects of grammatical gender and automated gendering in a technical context, some of whom might help you in writing related or similar tools.

There is one main specification ("spec"), as well as several extensions specifications ("ext-...").
To get started, you can download the [main specification](https://phseiff.com/gender-render/docs/specs/spec/latest.pdf), which dives further into the versioning scheme of gender\*render specifications, their vision and development model, or download any specification in any version from the following list.

Clicking a version number downloads the specification as a pdf file, whilst the <sup>[html<img alt="↗" src="docs/images/external-link-black.svg" height="10em">]</sup>-link next to every specification version leads to a hosted html version of the specification.
