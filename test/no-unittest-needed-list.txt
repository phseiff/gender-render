# This is a list of methods, classes and functions that do not need to be tested.

# whitelisted because it is a small helper function in a soon-to-be obsolete submodule, and already indirectly tested either way:
gender_render.gender_nouns.lwarn

# whitelisted because its functions are nothing but functionality from gender_render.parse_templates.StateTransitioner that was moved out to give better readability (and the StatTransitioner is already tested either way):
gender_render.parse_templates.Transitions

# Helper function whose effectivity is already implied by other tests passing:
gender_render.warnings.get_all_subclasses
